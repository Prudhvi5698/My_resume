        <p>
            As a senior systems engineer at Infosys, I have been
            deploying and maintaining Finacle, one of the world's
            leading banking software products, for the past two years to
            one of the major Australian banks in client location(Sydney). Finacle is a complex and scalable
            application that runs on
            JBoss and AWS cloud, and requires continuous integration
            and deployment strategies using tools like Jenkins, GIT, SVN, Docker and Kubernetes.

        <h3>Systems Engineer(07/2021 - 01/2023)</h3>
        <p>I joined Infosys as a systems engineer in July 2021, after
            graduating with a bachelor of technology degree in
            electronics and communications engineering from R.V.R. &
            J.C. College of Engineering. I have been passionate about
            infrastructure automation, cloud infrastructure, and cloud
            services, and I have developed these skills through my
            education and work experience. I enjoyed working with a
            diverse and collaborative team of engineers, and I strive to
            deliver high-quality and reliable solutions for our clients. My
            goal was to keep learning and growing as a DevOps
            engineer, and to contribute to the innovation and success of
            Infosys and Finacle.</p>
